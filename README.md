# Squad_Up
SquadUp is an Android app that is intended to be used in situations of emergency. We wanted people to feel safe and at peace, whether they be victims of abuse or students traveling alone at night on college campuses. Our app allows users to speak a discrete code which alerts and sends their location to contacts in their “squad.”

## Version 1.0
 Default message is sent to contacts in the following form:
 > I feel unsafe, my location is: Latitude = <latitude> Longitude = <longitude>
* Currently the location is in DD coordinates but will be changed to an address link in Version 2.
	
## Version 2.0 *(in progress)*
Upcoming features for SquadUp2.0 include:
- Allow for contacts to be directly imported from user's phone
- Conact "squad" in a group chat setting
- Automatically open camera/voice memos to capture evidence if neeeded
- Create an option for flashing light and/or sound to alert bystanders
